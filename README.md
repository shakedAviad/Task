# explanation:
The aim of the project is to classify words (sometimes with spelling mistakes) into groups.
Each word will eventually belong to a relevant group, with the user being able to choose how many groups he wants to present.


## Installation
The [Levenshtein](https://www.datacamp.com/community/tutorials/fuzzy-string-python) package must be installed 

```bash
pip install python-Levenshtein
```
## Usage
Clone this project
```bash
git clone https://github.com/shakedAviad/Task.git
```
Then there is a short main function with examples
Note: You can change the number of groups in the program, but we are currently returning the 3 largest groups

I hope you will find interest in this project and that we will find a common future :)
